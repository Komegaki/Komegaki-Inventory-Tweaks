Komegaki's Inventory Tweaks (KIT) - A Inventory Overhaul

This is a mod (simular to "Aura's Intentory Tweaks") that overhauls the SkyUI Inventory both visually and literally, through a variety of means like advanced sorting, custom frameworks and thoughtfully made icons.

NOTE : This is not a "UI Overhaul" mod like "Untarnished UI" "Edge UI" etc. (So they are compatible with this mod)
NOTE : I am currently in the process of completly redoing KIT (along with the GitHub Page as well). The Pre-releases of the "KIT v2.0 Beta" can be accessed and downloaded by clicking the "Releases" tab right above the last "Latest Release/Official Release"
